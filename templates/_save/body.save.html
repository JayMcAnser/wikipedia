      <div class=""> <span class="font-bold">Nan Hoover</span> (12 May 1931 – 9 June 2008) was a Dutch/American-expatriate artist who is known for her pioneering work in video art, photography and performance art.
        She spent almost four decades living and working in the Netherlands.
        She also used the mediums of drawing, painting, photography and film and created art objects and sculptures.
        One of the main themes of her art was light and motion.
        The rigorous, minimalist handling of her means as well as the intense concentration with which she performed within spaces of light and shadow are the most salient characteristics of her artistic work.</div>
